Description:

This Web App is designed to be a repository for Books and their Metadata. The site allows you to view all books and authors; as well as update, add, and remove entries. This app was written using Javascript, CSS, ASP.NET, and C#.

BUG as of 12/1/23: 

The inclusion of " ' " in an entry will break the app.

Future Additions: 

The inclusion of Picture uploading for authors and book covers.
